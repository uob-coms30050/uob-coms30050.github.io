# Welcome to (COMS30050/COMS30051/COMSM0055) Applied Data Science! : )

This unit runs for Year 3 and Year 4 undergraduates on the CS and Eng Maths single honours and joint honours degree programmes. About 100 students in total.

It is designed as an introduction to a range of Data Science topics and techniques and a chance to gain some practical experience with applying these to real data.

We will cover topics such as: ethics and privacy, data ingress, storage, wrangling, fusion, exploration and visualisation and deployment of data science systems. You will get to work on real data from a range of different areas.

We are excited to be bringing you a unit with a wider range of topics and ideas than before and we hope you find it a really interesting unit!

Please read through all the information on this Welcome page and then see the first week's lecture materials!

# Navigating the Course

Please read all of the information below carefully to find out how the unit will be run.

The Applied Data Science unit is a 20 credits mini-project unit.

The unit brings together over one hundred 3rd- and 4th-year undergraduate students from computer science degrees (including joint honours degrees) and engineering mathematics degrees. We have expanded the number of different group coursework data projects that are available and we are organising new additional content in the form of guest lectures and more practical lab sessions.

## Unit Structure 
The unit can be thought of as comprising two halves:

In Weeks 13 through 17 the unit delivers in-person lectures and demos, and in-person lab sessions that introduce key data science topics and skills. (Note: Week 18 is CS Consolidation Week, i.e., a reading week in which no classes are scheduled).

Weeks 19 to 23 are dedicated to your group coursework activity. Your group will have a half-hour in-person supervision meeting each week. During this period, we will also invite guest speakers, who are experts in various fields of data science, to share their insights, experiences, and the current trends in data science.

This format means that there is intensive delivery of material in Weeks 12 to 17 - a whole unit's worth of ideas is delivered in this period, so you will need to stay engaged and keep up. The unit is designed this way so that the coursework assessment that runs in Weeks 19 to 23 can be significant, rich and challenging.

In each of Weeks 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17, there will be (i) an in-person two-hour time-tabled lecture (on Tuesdays 9:00 - 11:00), (ii) an in-person two-hour timetabled lab session (on Thursday 9:00-11:00) in which you get practical experience related to the topic being taught that week. Both of these activities are relevant to all students on the unit, irrespective of whether you are a year 3 or year 4 undergraduate or a CS or Engineering Maths student. We will make available the lecture material prior to the lecture on Monday and pre-requisite lab material prior to the lab on Thursday.

### Labs
While you are in a lab, you will have access to two types of support: (i) support from TAs and lecturers, (ii) support from your classmates. The labs are not assessed. They are designed to help you learn relevant ideas and skills which will prepare you for the unit assessment. They are important and engaging in them fully will be key to doing well on the unit. Do the prep ahead of each lab session. Be prepared to discuss and work with your classmates. Helping a classmate to understand something or helping them explain something to you are both useful experiences that will improve the learning or both you and your classmate.

### Forum
This Blackboard page includes a link on the sidebar to a discussion forum. Please ask questions; discuss answers to questions; ask for clarification; point out broken links; discuss the content of lectures; offer encouragement to your classmates; etc.

### Coursework
All students on this unit will be assessed via one piece of group coursework worth 20 credits. If you are a year 3 undergraduate student you will be in a group with other year 3 undergraduates. If you are a year 4  undergraduate student you will be in a group with other year 4 undergraduates. If you are an undergraduate you will be in a group with a mix of students from different undergraduate degree programmes. Every undergraduate group will have some CS students and some Engineering Mathematics or Joint Honours students. This way every group will have a mix of skills. Data science is an inherently interdisciplinary activity and working in an interdisciplinary group is a key part of this Unit. We will facilitate group creation. 

### Assessment
All CW groups will be asked to carry out the same data science task on their data problem. However, Year 3 Undergraduates will be assessed against a marking scheme that is calibrated to the level expected of Year 3 students (with a pass mark of 40). Year 4 Undergraduates will be assessed against a marking scheme that is calibrated to the level expected of Masters level students (with a pass mark of 50). This is why there are two Unit codes associated with the CW submission: 

- COMS30051 - CW submission for Year 3 Undergraduates
- COMSM055 - CW submission for Year 4 Undergraduates

All unit activities are planned to be delivered in-person. We will strive to conduct all activities (e.g., Lectures and Labs) face-to-face on campus, but given that staff and students may fall ill or may be shielding, we may need to switch to a hybrid mode.

# Unit Contacts

- Seth Bullock (unit lecturer): https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~sb15704/

...and a team of Teaching Assistants

Wherever possible, please contact us through the Discussion Forum! This is by far the best way of getting your query answered quickly, keeping the discussion all in one convenient place, and ensuring that the other students can contribute to the question and benefit from the replies. If you wish, you may post anonymously on the forum. We do strongly encourage students to help answer questions (in addition to asking them).
