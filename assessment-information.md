## Coursework Brief and Guidance 

We recommend reading this entire page in detail before starting the coursework. 

### Overview

The goal of this coursework is to give you experience of the lifecycle of developing a data science application. The intended learning outcomes for the coursework are the same as those for the unit as a whole: 

- To acquire a working knowledge of practical data science, applied to real world problems. 
- To be able to start from raw data and deliver a representation that allows a better understanding of the topics in the data. 
- To have experience of using software tools for data pre-processing and management. 
- To acquire first-hand experience in specific techniques for data storage. 
- To understand the differences between different visualisation strategies to efficiently explore the data. 
- To have learned how to present and interpret data to/for a non-technical audience. 
- To be able to share data under privacy constraints. 
- To have practiced teamwork and time management. 

Your tasks in this coursework are: 

- Build a data science application that extracts useful findings from a real-world data set. 
- Work effectively as part of a group. 
- Follow a sound development process (e.g., see the CRISP-DM standard) taking due account of privacy and ethical issues. 
- Develop and demonstrate models, analysis, and visualisation that will generalize well to new data. 
- Deliver an informative interim presentation of your work in progress. 
- Submit a clear and useful report describing your work and your findings. 
- Write a thoughtful and interesting reflective discussion of the project. 

### Coursework Deliverables

This coursework has **three deliverables**: 

1. **Work-in-progress presentation**: Each group will prepare a short (max. 5 mins) *work-in-progress presentation* ahead of the penultimate week of the coursework period. Feedback on this presentation will help the group improve their final report. 
  - This presentation is worth 10% of the overall coursework mark. 

2. **Final report**: Each group will submit a single written *final report* at the end of the coursework period (max. 10 sides of A4 including references, submitted in IEEE conference format). 
-  This final report is worth 90% of the overall coursework mark. 
-  Note: All members of the group will be given the same mark for the final report. It is up to each team to decide their best strategy to tackle this coursework, i.e. whether to divide the tasks below, or to work together on all tasks. 

3. **Reflective discussion**: Each individual will submit a *reflective discussion* of their work (max. one side of A4 submitted in IEEE conference format), describing their role in the group, what their achievements were, and what they have learned from the course. The quality of this piece of work, combined with their supervisor's assessment of their contribution to the project will determine the final mark that each individual receives. 
- Note: This reflective discussion can only increase an individual's mark above that achieved by the group for deliverables 1 and 2. However, in exceptional scenarios such as a group losing an individual or an individual not contributing to the group work, their supervisor's assessment will determine the final mark each individual receives.


#### Work-in-Progress Presentation

Your group's presentation should be around 5 mins and should contain the following: 
- Introduction: The background to the problem tackled by the project. 
- Initial Thinking: What you decided to focus on and why. 
- Work So Far: The preliminary findings that have been obtained so far. 
- Things To Do: What remains to be done. 
- Challenges: Obstacles encountered and how you are approaching them. 

The (equally weighted) marking criteria for the presentation are: 
- Sound Rationale: Decisions and direction taken are explained well and make sense. 
- Technical Command: Treatment of technical issues is detailed, deep and convincing. 
- Effective Teamwork: Good evidence of collaboration, planning, communication. 
- Good Presentation: Presentation is succinct, clear, well-structured, comprehensive. 

Note: the presentation itself need not be particularly complex. An efficient, clear and informative presentation is what you should be aiming for, not one that is fancy. 

Note: the point is to enable us to give you helpful feedback that will improve your final report. Feel free to ask for advice on specific choices that you are making or approaches that you are considering. An honest “warts-and-all” account is better than a positive but partial story. 


#### Final Report

Your group's final report should contain the following: 

- Full names and usernames of all members in the team as well as a signed agreement (this can be digital) that all members contributed roughly equally. Contributions of team members need not be explicitly stated. 
- Abstract: A succinct account of the project and its findings. 
- Introduction: The background context for the problem tackled by the project. 
- Data Preparation: What data manipulation was necessary to prepare a dataset. 
- Data Exploration: What you learned from your initial exploration of the data. 
- Data Modelling: Details of the models, visualisation, and analyses that you developed, their strengths and weaknesses, and justifications for your approach and choices. You should include a technical description of any algorithms, tools, methods, methodology used (referencing the scientific literature or equivalent wherever appropriate). 
- Findings: Details of your findings, results, insights, etc. Use appropriate visualisations. 
- Discussion and Conclusion: What has the project delivered in terms of knowledge, understanding and insight into the problem that it addressed? 

The marking criteria for the final report are: 

- Problem Understanding: To what extent have you understood and explained the goals of the project, taking account of end-user requirements (15 marks). 
- Data Wrangling and Exploration: To what extent has extraction, preparation and manipulation of the data been robust, systematic and sophisticated; Depth of insights gained through the initial exploration of the data (15 marks). 
- Data Modelling, visualisation, Analysis and Evaluation: Effectiveness of tools chosen and deployed; Appropriateness of the modelling approach; Soundness of statistical and machine learning methods applied; Sophistication of the visualisations employed; Effectiveness and insight of the evaluation (40 marks). 
- Discussion and Conclusion: Utility of the project findings for the end user (15 marks). 
- Presentation: Fluency and coherence of the written text; Quality of the figures, charts, graphs, etc. (15 marks). 


#### Reflective Discussion

Each group's report will be marked using the criteria described above and this will be used to set an overall mark for each group. Each individual's mark will be determined based on this overall mark (so it is in everyone's interests to collaborate well) with a potential bonus based on the individual's contribution. This will be assessed partly by your attendance at and contribution to meetings with your group's supervisor and partly based on a 1-page reflective discussion document that describes your role in the group, what your achievements were, and what you have learned from the course. Your reflective discussion could contain the following kinds of material, but the content is up to you: 

- Account of your personal contribution to the project. 
- Discussion of the overall strengths and weaknesses of the project. 
- Reflection on how the project related to the ideas taught on the unit. 
- Discussion of your achievements and what the project experience taught you. 

The marking criteria for the reflective discussion are: 

 - Significance of contribution to the project. 
 - Appreciation of the project's strengths and weaknesses. 
 - Appreciation of how the material taught on the unit relates to the project. 
 - Reflection on achievements and what was learned from the project experience. 


### Marking for COMSM0055

The way in which the marking criteria for all three deliverables are applied for students in the fourth year of an undergraduate degree will be consistent with the elevated expectations associated with an M-level unit. In such cases, work will be expected to exhibit a deep and mature level of analysis and reflection, and the application of tools and methods will be expected to be accomplished and their evaluation and interpretation sophisticated. 

For example, for a solid piece of M-level work: 

-    Machine learning methods will be expected to be used in a way that demonstrates command of the methods and the ability to tailor them to the problem at hand, rather than merely exploiting off the shelf techniques. 
-    Visualisation should be carefully considered in terms of accurate and unbiased representation of the data and some innovation in terms of visualisation methods may be expected. 
-    Analysis of findings will be expected to go beyond summary statistics and qualitative comparisons to include relevant quantitative inferential statistical methods. 
-    Etc. 


### Marking Guideline


Note: Report will be checked for plagiarism or academic misconduct. Proven plagiarism will result in a coursework grade of 0 for the whole team. Your use of AI during this coursework and report writing should follow University and Faculty Guidelines in which all prompts must be cited. Bear in mind that ChatGPT and other language models struggle to write academic reports to a high standard of 2.1 or above. Hallucinated text will penalise you heavily as it shows a lack of understanding. Note that not referencing the prompts you use represents academic misconduct and poor academic practice! 


## FAQs: Working in a Group 

Q1. How will individual marks be assigned to each member in the group? 

All members in the group will receive the same marks for the final report. Reflective discussion only increases the marks an individual receives. In exceptional scenarios, however, the coursework supervisor's assessment will determine the final mark each individual in a group receives. 

Q2. What if one or more of my team members doesn't engage with the coursework? 

We expect each member of the group to contribute equally (though this could be in different areas – maybe one student is working on the data preparation and report writing, another on data exploration and visualisation, another researching and developing various models). If this is not the case, you should contact the unit director ASAP. By submitting the report, it is assumed that all group members are happy with the contribution of their team members with the signed agreement. 

Q3. What if one or more of my team members becomes ill or has exceptional circumstances and has to resit? 

In this case it is expected that the remaining members of the group will finish and complete the coursework on their own. Further, each member of the group should highlight in their individual reflection discussion how they navigated such circumstances. 

Q4. What is the signed agreement? 

You must include the following at the beginning of your report: "We agree that all members have contributed to this project in an approximately equal manner" with signatures of all group members below it. 

Q5. I have a Study Support Plan (SSP) 

Talk to Nirav at the earliest and we can discuss how to we can tailor the coursework to your SSP.
