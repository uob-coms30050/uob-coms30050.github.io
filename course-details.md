# Welcome to Applied Data Science (COMS30050/COMS30051/COMSM0055)

This unit runs for Year 3 and Year 4 undergraduates on the CS and Eng Maths single honours and joint honours degree programmes. About 100 students in total.

It is designed as an introduction to a range of Data Science topics and techniques and a chance to gain some practical experience with applying these to real data.

We will cover topics such as: ethics and privacy, data ingress, storage, wrangling, fusion, exploration and visualisation and deployment of data science systems. You will get to work on real data from a range of different areas.

We are excited to be bringing you a unit with a wider range of topics and ideas than before and we hope you find it a really interesting unit!

Please read through all the information on this page and skim through the [refresher](refresher)!

- Nirav Ajmeri, Seth Bullock, and the TA team.
