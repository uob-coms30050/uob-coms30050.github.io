# Lab 3: Exploring Graph Database Using Neo4j (To be finalised)

This lab builds on the lectures on Data Management and Wrangling. The lab will involve exploring the Paradise Papers graph database using Neo4j. 

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for Neo4j Sandbox: <https://sandbox.neo4j.com/login?ref=sandbox-lp-cta>
  - This runs Neo4j in your browser and is the **Preferred Option** for this lab
- Alternatively, you could install the Neo4j Desktop version from the Neo4j Developer page (<https://neo4j.com/developer/>).
  - This setup requires additional steps and is **Not Preferred** for this lab.
  - Neo4j Desktop: <https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/#neo4j-tools>
  - Download Paradise Papers dataset: <https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database>

## Before the Lab

To prepare for Lab 3, follow these steps before Thursday (give yourself plenty of time):

- Revisit the lecture on Data Management
- *Important:* Watch Luis Vaquero's Neo4j video [13 mins]: <https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/COMS30050_2025_TB-2/lectures/Week%203%20Materials/GraphDBs.mp4>

- Get acquainted with Neo4j and the Cypher Query Language
  - <https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/cypher-intro/>
Read about Paradise Papers
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Papers>

- **If using the Neo4j Sandbox version (in your browser):**
  - Login to Neo4j Sandbox
  - After Sign up or Login, you will be given the choice of starting a project from scratch or using pre-built data (choose the latter) 
  - Scroll down through the Pre-built Data options and select "Paradise Papers by ICIJ", then click on "Create and Download Credentials"
    - Note that projects in Neo4j Sandbox expire in 3 days.
    - You may need to recreate your project if your previous project expires.
    - Consider saving externally any queries you try on the sandbox.
  - Click on "Open with browser" and then "Sandbox login"
  - A browser tab will open including access to Neo4j
  - In that tab, there is a panel to the left with 5 different sections that you should read and understand
  - Watch the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4XeBz1hYJQ) (4 mins) to get more context on the Paradise Papers
  - Copy this ':play https://guides.neo4j.com/sandbox/icij-paradise-papers/datashape.html' (without the quote marks)
  - Paste it (without the quote marks) in the Neo4j command line box at the top of your browser (to the right of the "neo4j$" prompt)
  - A node-relationship diagram will appear. Read through all nine info canvases "<………>"
  - Follow the examples (choosing a person or organisation of interest from the link therein):
