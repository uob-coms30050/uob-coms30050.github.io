# Data Projects (To be confirmed)

## Project 1. Analysing Social Media Impact on Public Discourse
This project aims to explore the role of social media in shaping public discourse and influencing societal trends. With billions of users worldwide, platforms such as Bluesky, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit facilitate real-time communication and information sharing, impacting how individuals engage with topics such as politics, health, and social movements. Collecting and analysing data from these platforms, enables investigating trends in discussions, user engagement, and the influence of significant events on public opinion. The project will involve data collection from social media platforms using APIs or web scraping techniques, utilise natural language processing (NLP) and statistical methods to analyse trends, sentiment, and user interactions, and create visualisation to uncover insights into the complexities of social media's impact on public opinion, communication strategies, and societal change.

- Bluesky Social dataset: <https://zenodo.org/records/14258401>
- Dataset on Covid-19 tweets: <https://globalaffects.org/covid-news/>
- Dataset on US election tweets: <https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets> 

## Project 2. Analysing UNICEF Data (e.g., Gender Equality, Child Nutrition)
UNICEF (<https://data.unicef.org/>) offers a comprehensive collection of datasets that are vital for understanding various aspects of children's and women's rights and well-being. These datasets cover a range of critical topics, including education, gender equality, HIV/AIDS, mortality, child nutrition, poverty, and child protection.

For instance, those related to nutrition and gender can be found by exploring these sites:

- Child nutrition: <https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/child-nutrition/>
- Gender: <https://data.unicef.org/topic/gender/overview/>  
- Datasets: <https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets/> 

By exploring these datasets, you can create visualisations and predictive models to tell compelling stories about these important issues, potentially linking them with other relevant UNICEF datasets to provide a more comprehensive understanding of children's and women's lives.

## Project 3. Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data 
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death. In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. 

This formed the 2019 Physionet Computing in Cardiology Challenge. The goal of this project is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data, which can be found, together with more background information, here https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/

## Project 4. Activity Recognition with Multimodal Sensor Data 
The task of this project is to predict the activities of residents within a smart home based only on observed sensor data. Sensor data are obtained from the following three sensing modalities: a wrist-worn accelerometer, video + depth (RGB-D), and passive environmental presence sensors.

Data, metadata, and other information can all be found at this server: <https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/8gccwpx47rav19vk8x4xapcog>  


## Project 5. European Productivity  
The EU Open Data portal maintains many datasets related to social and economic trends across the EU. 

For example, the data on labour productivity per hour worked, or economic sentiment: 
- <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/tesem160> 
- <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/teibs010>

Your task is to analyse trends in this data and relationships between outcomes, potentially making use of other EU Open Data portal datasets that may help you enrich your analysis (such as that for education, or COVID-related data).


## Project 6. European Social Survey (ESS) Data
The European Social Survey (ESS) (<https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/>) is cross-national survey that measures attitudes, beliefs, and behaviour patterns of people across Europe. It is funded by its participating countries in Europe and was awarded European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) status in 2013, by the European Commission. ESS' data portal provides freely accessible data on topics such as democracy, media consumption, immigration, social trust, well-being, health, and political engagement, collective from representative samples in participating counties. As an example, a project could be on analysis of political attitudes, social trust over time, clustering countries based on well-being indicators, or predictive modelling of voting behaviour, applying statistical methods, machine learning, and data visualisation techniques.

Data is available free of charge for non-commercial use, and each country has a minimum sample size of 1500 participants.  Their data portal has some nice interactive elements that can be used (https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data-portal), which may be used to find a specific topic of interest quickly.

## Project 7. NFL Big Data Bowl
NFL is the most popular sport in the US. This dataset is from NFL Big Data Bowl 2025. The data provides location information for each special teams player, wherever they are on the field, and includes their speed, acceleration, and direction.  In this project, you will apply your data science learning to better understand these plays.

More details about the dataset is here:
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/overview>

You could download the dataset using Kaggle's API.

## Project 8. NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data is a public dataset that provides detailed information about taxi and for-hire vehicle trips in New York City, including pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, trip distances, and fare amounts. Data science projects using this dataset could include trip pattern analysis to create heatmaps of popular locations, developing machine learning models to predict taxi fares, and analysing trip durations to identify traffic congestion patterns. Additionally, researchers could assess the environmental impact of taxi operations, explore customer behaviour through payment methods and trip durations, and investigate how major events affect taxi demand in specific areas. These projects can yield valuable insights into urban transportation dynamics and support informed decision-making for city planners and taxi operators.
